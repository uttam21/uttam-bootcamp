I’m Uttam, an Android developer with over 5 years of experience building scalable and user-friendly mobile applications. I specialize in Kotlin and have strong expertise in modern Android architecture components, including ViewModel, LiveData, coroutines, and Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection.

I have worked extensively on white-label app solutions, where I streamlined app delivery processes—reducing turnaround from 2–3 days to under an hour, improving overall efficiency by ~95%. I’m experienced in integrating analytics, handling complex UI workflows, managing parallel API calls, and optimizing app performance.

I enjoy exploring the internals of Android frameworks, solving challenging bugs, and mentoring junior developers. My focus is on writing clean, maintainable code while ensuring the best possible user experience.
